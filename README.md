# grunt-ssh-deploy (Version: 0.3.1)

> SSH Deployment for Grunt using [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2).

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.4`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-ssh-deploy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-ssh-deploy');
```

## The tasks

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `environments` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  environments: {
    environment: {
      // Environment specific options here
    }
  },
});
```

This plugin will connect to your remote host, add a directory to releases/ in your `remote_path`, and create a symlink to the latest release.

The symlink by default is `current`, you can change this by setting `current_symlink`. 

### Usage
By setting an environment, you can deploy each specific one with `grunt ssh_deploy:environment` or rolling back with `grunt ssh_rollback:environment`.

### Options

#### options.host
Type: `String`

Remote host to connect to.

#### options.username
Type: `String`

The username to connect as on the remote server.

#### options.password
Type: `String`

Password for the username on the remote server.

#### options.privateKey
Type: `string`

Path to your private key `privateKey: require('fs').readFileSync('/path/to/private/key')`

#### options.passphrase
Type: `string`

Passphrase of your private key if needed.

#### options.agent
Type: `string`

Set agent `agent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK`

#### options.port
Type: `String`
Default value: `'22'`

Port to connect to on the remote server.

#### options.deploy_path
Type: `String`

Full path on the remote server where files will be deployed.

#### options.local_path
Type: `String`

Path on your local for the files you want to be deployed to the remote server. No trailing slash needed.

#### options.current_symlink
Type: `String`
Default value: `'current'`

Path to directory to symlink with most recent release.

#### options.before_deploy, options.after_deploy
Type: `String`

Commands to run on the server before and after deploy directory is created and symlinked. 

#### options.tag
Type: `String|function`
Default value: the current date (as a timestamp)

The release tag, e.g. '1.2.3'. It can be a string or a function (in that case is called and the returned value will be
used). It defaults to the current timestamp formatted as 'YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS'.

*WARN*: release tag name **matters**. When used with parameter `releases_to_keep` the releases are reverse sorted
alphabetically and older ones are removed. So be careful when you set your release tag name.

#### options.release_subdir
Type: `String`

to the same machine and the `releases_to_keep` option is being used.

#### options.release_root
Type: `String`
Default value: `'releases'`

Name of the root directory where all the releases are published. If a `options.release_subdir` is also provided then
the latest will be appended after this path.

#### options.zip_deploy
